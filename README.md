# JS | Basic Algorithms

Welcome to your first bootcamp exercise at IronHack!

The goal of this exercise is to get you acquainted with the different control structures we have in JavaScript.

Ready?

## Introduction

For this Pair-Programming activity we are going to use a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop). You can fine a REPL that runs in the browser for programming languages as JavaScript in [repl.it](https://repl.it/)

We could also type JavaScript code in an editor, and then execute it to see the results in the REPL.

Ready to start?

## Requirements

- Go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript) and create an account (or login if you have one)
- Open a new repl.it and make sure the language is ==JavaScript==
- Type this in the ==Code Editor== (left panel)

  ```javascript
  console.log("I'm Ready!");
  ```
- Press `run â–º`
- If you can see the message on the JavaScript REPL, you're ready!!

## Submission

When you are done and you have checked that everything works fine, go to https://gist.github.com/, create a new [secret gist](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/#secret-gists) and send it to your Instructor.

**Remember:** Remember to add the extension of the file `fileName`**.js** in the *"Filename including extension"* input box so you can enjoy [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting) in your gist
 
## Exercise

### Names and Input

1. Create a variable `hacker1` with the driver's name

2. Print `"The driver's name is XXXX"` 

3. Create a variable `hacker2` and [ask the user](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) for the navigator's name

4. Print `"The navigator's name is YYYY"`

### Conditionals

5. Depending on which name [is longer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length), print:
	- `The Driver has the longest name, it has XX characters` or 
	- `Yo, navigator got the longest name, it has XX characters` or
	- `wow, you both got equally long names, XX characters!!`

### Loops

6. Print all the characters of the driver's name, separated by a space and [in capitals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase)
  ie. `"J O H N"`
  
7. Print all the characters of the navigator's name, in reverse order. 
  ie. `"nhoJ"`
  
8. Depending on the [lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order) of the strings, print:
  - `The driver's name goes first`
  - `Yo, the navigator goes first definitely`
  - `What?! You both got the same name?`

### Bonus Time!

9. Ask the user for a new string and check if it's a [Palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome). Examples of palindromes:
	- "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
	- "Amor, Roma"
	- "race car"
	- "stack cats"
	- "step on no pets"
	- "taco cat"
	- "put it up"
	- "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" and "No 'x' in Nixon".

10. Go to [lorem ipsum generator](http://www.lipsum.com/) and:
  - Generate 3 parragraphs. Store the text in a String
  - Make your program count the number of words in the string
  - Make your program count the number of times the latin word [`et`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/et#Latin)appears
