// Iteration 1: Names and Input

const hacker1 = prompt("driver's name ?");
console.log(The driver's name is ${hacker1})
const hacker2 = prompt("navigator's name ?")
console.log(The navigator's name is ${hacker2})

// Iteration 2: Conditionals

let driver = hacker1.length
let navigator = hacker2.length
let egality = driver || navigator
if (driver > navigator) { console.log(The driver has the longest name, it has ${driver} characters.) }
else if (navigator > driver) { console.log(It seems that the navigator has the longest name, it has ${navigator} characters) }
else console.log(Wow, you both have equally long names, ${egality} characters!)

// Iteration 3: Loops
console.log(hacker1.toUpperCase());
